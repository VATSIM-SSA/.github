## Welcome to VATSSA - VATSIM Sub-Sahara Africa Division on Github. ðŸ‘‹

VATSSA is responsible for the airspace of 40 countries and territories in Africa, in its Sub Saharan region. We cover the airspace from Cape Verde in the West to Mauritius in the East all the way to South Africa... well, we also cover some bits in Antartica.

We use Github not only to help us develop and manage our 26 Sector Files but also to develop, where possible, our web platforms (Site, eAIP, Training Platform).

We have a limited number of internal resources, but we try to do our best for our community where we can.

For more information, visit us at https://vatssa.com or join our Discord via VATSIM's Community Hub.
